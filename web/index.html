                The following is a demonstration of a toy project I worked on in Java to learn the fundamentals of programming, both by doing the actual work and by studying the subject matter. It's an interpreter of expressions in prefix notation. It takes an expression, calculates its value, and displays the steps involved in the calculation. It's still a work in progress and there are some known issues that will need to be debugged.
